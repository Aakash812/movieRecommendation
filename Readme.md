# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the Movie Recommendation System repository. This project is a culmination of efforts to design and develop a robust movie recommendation system that enhances user experience by providing precise and relevant movie recommendations.

## Highlights:
- Achieved an impressive **90% accuracy rate** in movie recommendations.
- Enhanced the user experience for **150 beta testers**.
- Developed as part of a **data mining group project**.

## Algorithms and Techniques:
- **k-means clustering** combined with **Apriori** for recommendation logic.
- Employed two additional clustering algorithms to optimize recommendation accuracy.
- Utilized industry-standard **data science libraries** and tools.

## Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - scikit-learn: For implementing recommendation algorithms.
  - pandas: For data preprocessing and analysis.

## How to Use:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed. If not, run `pip install scikit-learn pandas`.
3. Execute the Jupyter notebook to view the recommendation logic and results.
